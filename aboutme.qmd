title: "About Me"

<br>

I currently work with Boeing's Global Services applying classical and cutting edge machine learning techniques to aircraft health analysis. My work is largely with the United States' military, using predictive analytics to keep our fleets and active service members mission ready.

I completed my MS in Data Science from Georgetown in Spring 2023 after completing my BA in [Economics](https://economics.dartmouth.edu/) and [Quantitative Social Science](https://qss.dartmouth.edu/) from Dartmouth College in 2021. Academically and professionally, my goal is to use data science to do good in the world - whether that's keeping aircrafts safe, identifying vulnerable communities for climate funding, or investigating hate speech/fraudulent text on social media.

I love being able to explore the data behind these problems in order to generate meaningful and defensible change - and delivering complex solutions in concise and accessible ways to move that needle is where my greatest strengths lie.

Outside of Data Science I love being outside - skiing, biathlon, climbing, biking, backpacking, and roller blading, especially with friends, is the best part of life! Plus, I love a [good book](reading.html). <br>

Feel free to reach out if you have questions about any of this work or just wanna chat. <br>
