title: "About Me"

<br>

I'm Elise Rust and I plan to finish my MS in Data Science from Georgetown in Spring 2023 after completing my undergrad in [Economics](https://economics.dartmouth.edu/) and [Quantitative Social Science](https://qss.dartmouth.edu/) from Dartmouth College in 2021. Academically and professionally, my goal is to use data science to do good in the world - whether that's addressing the climate crisis or identifying vulnerable communities for educational funding or investigating hate speech/fraudulent text on social media. Whether it's using statistical analysis, machine learning, natural language processing, or spatial reasoning I find great joy in taking data science problems of all types through the entire data science lifecycle. I love being able to explore the data behind these problems in order to generate meaningful and defensible change - and delivering complex solutions in concise and accessible ways to move that needle is where my greatest strengths lie.

Outside of Data Science I love being outside - skiing, biathlon, climbing, biking, backpacking, and roller blading, especially with friends, is the best part of life! Plus, I love a [good book](reading.html). <br>
