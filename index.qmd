Currently a Data Science and Analytics master's student at [Georgetown University](https://www.georgetown.edu/), far away from my home base of California.

My immediate academic interests are telling stories with data, especially as they pertain to the environment, public policy, and the endless world of text data.

Prior to graduate school and my time in DC, I developed a love of climate work (plus skiing and climbing) at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/).

I'm currently looking for work in the climate space - trying to use my technical analysis, model building, and writing/presenting skills to make the world a better place.

Here's a [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MFYSplOitF6I4DpnSNfqjAgMBYPJxKB7_zJo1x6wu7o/edit?usp=sharing)
