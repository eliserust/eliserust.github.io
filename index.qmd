Currently an Engineering Data Scientist with [Boeing's Global Services](https://www.boeing.com/services) sector, using machine learning, artificial neural networks, and natural language processing to analyze and forecast the health of aircrafts for our military customers.

Prior to my time with Boeing, I received my Masters in Data Science and Analytics from [Georgetown University](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/), with a focus on sentiment analysis of political discourse and statistical modeling of climate change.

I grew a love for data (plus skiing and hiking) at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/)!
